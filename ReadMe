A simple tutorial site (activity for e-commerce subject), design was inspired by catswhocode and google. :D

## Getting Started
## Why color blue?
Blue is a peaceful and calming color exuding stability and expertise. It is a common color used in corporate sites because of this. Blue can also symbolize trust and dependability.
A cool shade can bring about the negative side of blue, symbolizing depression, coldness, and passiveness.
